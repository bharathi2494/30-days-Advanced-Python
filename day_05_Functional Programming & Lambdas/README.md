# Day 5 – Functional Programming & Lambdas (Python)
## 📌 Overview
Day 5 focuses on Functional Programming concepts in Python, with emphasis on lambda expressions, map, filter, reduce, and pure functions.
These concepts help write cleaner, more concise, and predictable code.

## Topics Covered
- Lambda Functions
- Functional Built-in Functions
    - map()
    - filter()
    - reduce()
- Pure Functions

# Learning Objectives
- Write and use lambda (anonymous) functions
- Replace traditional loops using functional constructs
- Understand and apply pure functions
- Implement functional utilities manually

# Key Concepts Summary
- Lambda functions are single-expression anonymous functions
- map() transforms data
- filter() selects data
- reduce() aggregates data
- Pure functions improve reliability and testability
