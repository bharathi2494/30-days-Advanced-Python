# Day 7 – Closures & Decorators (Python Advanced)
This repository covers advanced Python concepts related to scope management, closures, and decorators, explained with clean examples and real-world use cases.  
These concepts are widely used in frameworks, system design, logging, authentication, retries, and performance monitoring.

# Topics Covered
## 🔹 LEGB Rule (Scope Resolution)
- Local
- Enclosing
- Global
- Built-in
How Python searches for variables

## 🔹 Closures
- Nested functions
- Remembering enclosing variables
- Function factories
- Data hiding

## 🔹 Decorators
- Function wrapping
- Enhancing behavior without modification
- Real-world decorator patterns

## 🔹 Decorators with Arguments
- Multi-level decorator structure
- Flexible and configurable decorators

# Tasks Implemented
## Retry Decorator
- Retries a function when an exception occurs
- Supports configurable retry count and delay

## Timing Decorator
- Measures function execution time
- Useful for performance analysis

## Authentication Decorator
- Restricts access based on user authorization
- Demonstrates real-world access control

## ⭐ Key Takeaway
Decorators are closures that modify behavior without changing the original function.
