# Day 4 – Dunder (Magic) Methods in Python
## Overview
This module covers Dunder (Magic) Methods in Python, which allow developers to define custom behavior for built-in operations such as printing objects, comparing objects, sorting, and calling objects like functions.  
Dunder methods begin and end with double underscores (__) and are automatically invoked by Python.

# 🧠 Topics Covered
## 1. `__str__ and __repr__`
- Custom string representation of objects
- User-friendly vs developer-friendly output
- Used during printing and debugging

## 2.` __eq__` (Equality Comparison)
- Enables object comparison using ==
- Compares object data instead of memory location

## 3. Ordering Methods
- `__lt__, __gt__, __le__, __ge__`
- Used to sort custom objects

## 4. `__call__`
- Allows objects to behave like functions
- Useful for callable objects and stateful behavior
